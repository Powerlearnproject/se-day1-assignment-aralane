#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, tools, and methods to the development and maintenance of high-quality software systems. This involves designing, developing and maintaining software products.The importance of software engineering in the technology industry is due to its role in enabling the creation of reliable, scalable and innovative software solutions that meet user needs such as software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life, such as communication, entertainment , commerce and healthcare.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Three key milestons in the evolution of software engineering include the development of programming languages (example, Fortran,C), the establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s, and lastly the advent of structured programming in the 1970s

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements: The user needs and system requirements are gathered and documented.
Design: High-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface are created.
Impementation: Writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
Testing: Various tests are conducted to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
Deployment: This is where the software is released to users and customers
Maintenance: This phase provides ongoing support , updates , and enhancements to the software after deployment.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
The Waterfall methodology has a sequential approach with distinct phases (such as requirements, design, implementation ) flowing downwards like a waterfall. A scenario for this would be projects with well-defined and stable requirements such as building a bridge or a physical product where changes are costly and time-consuming. 

The Agile methodology is an iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration and responding to change. Agile is appropriate for software development projects with evolving or unclear requirements, where rapid adaptation to changes and continuous feedback are essential such as developing a new mobile app or a web-based service.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer: Responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions
Quality Assurance Engineer: Ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans
Project Manager: Oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
The importance of IDEs and VCS  is due to their ability to enhance productivity, collaboration, and code quality by providing developers with features such as code editors, version control, debugging tools and automated testing capabilities.
IDEs provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging and testing code (examples include Visual Studio and Eclipse).
VCS track changes to source code and help coordination work among team members ( examples include Git and Subversion)

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Challenges faced by software engineers include :
Changing requirements during the development cycle which can lead to scope creep and project delays.
Tight deadlines which can result in rushed development of software product and compromised quality.
Technical debt which can impede development efforts and increase maintenance costs
Strategies to overcome these challanges include effective communication, agile methodologies, prioritization of tasks, and regular reassessment of project goals and timelines.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing is the testing of individual components or modules of software
Integration testing is the testing of interactions between different components or subsystems
Acceptance testing is the testing of software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs
They are important in software quality assurance as as testing is a critical aspect of quality assurance to help identify and fix defects early in the development process, leading to higher-quality software products. 

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the practice of carefully crafting specific instructions, questions or statements to get the best responses from AI models.It is important in interacting with AI models as well-designed prompts significantly influence the quality and usefulness of the generated output.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
An example of a vague prompt would be asking the question: " Tell me about microbiology?" and improving it by making it clear , specific , and concise by asking " Tell me about the impact of microbiology in the healthcare sector"
The improved prompt is more effective as it was clearly stated that they want the impact that microbiology has and was specific as to which sector or industry they want to know this impact to be in.
